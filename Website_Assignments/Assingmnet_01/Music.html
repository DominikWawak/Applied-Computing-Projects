  My parents <em>made</em> me start music back at the age of 7 when a random flyer came to our post box. I started out playing guitar and piano, later on I quit my piano lessons and stuck with the guitar only. Throughout my secondary school years I made two rock bands but didn't really have much sucess with both. Having said that its still one of my favourite hobbies that I enjoy doing in my spare time.</p>
<p class="meparagraph">My favourite streaming app is spotify. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX1lwxXvReaux" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find my favourite playlist. </p>
