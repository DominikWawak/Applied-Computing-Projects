	<p class="meparagraph"> Hi, from this webpage I hope you can learn more about me and my work, My name is Dominik Wawak and I come from a family of 6 . Im originally from Poland and take great pride in that.
	  I am a big fan of overcoming fears , challengig myself and doing things that I may not particularly find comfortable.
	  Im not one of those cliche "sieze the day" type of people. I try to be relaxed and see whats going to come next... <br>
	  Right now I am a student of Waterford IT . I study Applied Computing I feel like Im enjoying the course so far but Im still not sure if this is what I would like to do in the future. Having said that its very interesting. </p>
